# Compare genes mapped to enhancers with RNA-Seq data

1. Percentage of target genes detected to be significantly differntially expressed along with a t-test comparison of their log fold changes against all other genes

2. Scatterplot of average changes in enhancer activity versus changes in target genes expression
